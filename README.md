# TissueProf
This plugin is used to analyze the co-expression of multiple genes/proteins/molecules of interest in 
cells that are found in one or more zones of the target tissue. It takes as input a multi-channel
confocal image and outputs a Results file in excel format as well as various ROI sets 
and images that are saved during analysis for tracing the data and later review. 

TissueProf has been developed by Emre Dusunceli in the Namba Lab (ORCID ID: 0000-0003-4875-666X).
